In this study the spatial organization of Trade wind shallow cumulus populations as diagnosed from large domain LES is investigated, with a special focus on the implications for cumulus parametrization in the grey zone of convective parametrization. For this, various expressions of the nearest neighbor spacing for shallow cumulus are studied, exploring in particular how cloud spacing depends on cloud size. Four different definitions are used, these include the spacing between clouds of any size, the spacing between clouds of similar size and using either cloud edge spacing or cloud center spacing. We report a different relation between cloud size and spacing for different definitions; the relation is exponential for the spacing between clouds of similar size and logarithmic for the spacing between clouds of any size. A simple conceptual model is formulated to explain this behaviour, suggesting that randomly distributed small clouds can cause the logarithmic dependence.
